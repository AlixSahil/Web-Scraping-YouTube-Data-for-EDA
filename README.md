# Web Scraping YouTube Data for EDA

## Overview
This project involves extracting and analyzing YouTube channel statistics and video details using the **YouTube Data API**. The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on tech educator channels to identify trends and insights.

## Features
- Scraped YouTube channel statistics (subscribers, views, videos) for top tech educators.
- Collected video-specific data (views, likes, comments) from the **Code With Harry** channel.
- Conducted data preprocessing using **Pandas & NumPy**.
- Visualized trends using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **YouTube Data API**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WebScraping-YouTube-EDA.git
   cd WebScraping-YouTube-EDA
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up YouTube Data API key:
   - Get API key from [Google Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Add it to the script where required.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Results & Insights
- Extracted channel statistics and compared engagement metrics across multiple tech education channels.
- Analyzed video performance trends to determine user engagement and content reach.

## Future Enhancements
- Automate data extraction using scheduled API calls.
- Expand analysis to multiple YouTube categories.
- Deploy an interactive dashboard for visualization.
